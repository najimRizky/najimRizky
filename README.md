## Hello There âœŒ

As a recent graduate of Universitas Multimedia Nusantara, majoring in informatics, I am passionate about software development, with a focus on both front-end and back-end. With 1.5 years of work experience in this field, I have had the opportunity to contribute to numerous projects, honing my skills in various technology stacks. My expertise lies in JavaScript/TypeScript environments, utilizing technologies such as React, Express, and Next.js. However, I am also well-versed in other tech stacks. I possess a critical thinking mindset and actively seek opportunities to enhance my skills through online courses and personal projects, consistently striving to broaden my knowledge base and stay up-to-date with the latest industry trends.
